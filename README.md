# AssociationRulesMining
Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is an unsupervised method meaning there is no response variable to train on. In this project, I have applied association rules on the Adult Data set from the UCI repository to mine some interesting rules to be able to find associations between other demographic attributes and Salary. I have also built a Shiny App that to visulize the rules and fine_tune the algorithm.
